# Accurate, Efficient and Scalable Graph Embedding

Open source code for the GCN training algorithm in the IEEE/IPDPS'19 paper.

In progress of cleaning up the code...

We will finish the cleanup process by July 10. We will have a CPU and GPU implementation, where CPU multi-core parallelization follows the parallelization strategy in the paper and GPU is simply handled by Tensorflow.
